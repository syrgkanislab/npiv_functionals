# Installation

Before running any script you need to install the mliv package by running:

```
python setup.py develop
```

The main dependencies of the package are, cvxopt, scikit-learn, numpy, pytorch.

cvxopt is installed by running the setup.py command above. The rest need to be installed independently.

# MLIV Package

This will install the package `mliv` on your python environment, which contains all the non-parametric instrumental variable estimators proposed in the paper. It contains the components:
* `mliv.neuralnet`: estimators based on neural nets, using pytorch. See [Neural Net Notebook](local_notebooks/NeuralNetExamples.ipynb) and [MNIST Experiments Notebook](local_notebooks/MNIST_Experiments.ipynb) for example usage.

  * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue
